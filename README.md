# &lt;WebdevHome /&gt;

[webdevhome.github.io](https://webdevhome.github.io)

This is a collection of links I as a web developer use very frequently. Maybe you will find them useful, too.

## Planned Features

- [x] Filter links by typing their name and open a page by pressing `Return`
- [x] Possibility to customize which links are visible
- [ ] Submit searches of supported sites from within this site (similar to Chrome's Omnibar)
- [ ] MOAR LINKS! \(°O°)/
