# //webdev/home

This is a collection of links I as a web developer use very frequently. Maybe you will find them useful, too.

**Planned Features:**

- Submit searches of supported sites from within this site (similar to Chrome's Omnibar)
- Possibility to customize which links are visible
- MOAR LINKS!
